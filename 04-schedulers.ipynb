    "There are two main ways to achieve single-machine parallelism in python: multiple threads or multiple processes.\n",
    "The best choice depends on the type of work you're doing and Python's GIL (global interpreter lock).\n",
    "\n",
    "The GIL is an implementation detail of CPython. It's a lock deep inside your python process that limits things so *only one thread in your process can be running python code at once*. Fortunately for us, the performance-sensitive parts of libraries like NumPy and Pandas are written in C or Cython. Wherever possible, NumPy and pandas release the GIL. This means that for numeric workloads, we don't really have to worry about the GIL. Most IO operations (reading from a file, making an HTTP request) also release the GIL.\n",
